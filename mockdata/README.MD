### ERD

The ERD is generated using [erd](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd).

To generate a new version of the diagram,

1) Install `erd` - there are many options. Check out the README.
2) Build the `erd` PDF, `erd -i ./mockdata-erd.er -o ./mockdata-erd.pdf` (run from ./mockdata)

There are other routes to installing and running the tool. See the [readme](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd) for more details.
